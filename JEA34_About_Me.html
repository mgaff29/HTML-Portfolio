        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Sam Ashmore, the founder and lead architect of JEA-34 Architecture.<br>
           With a background in modern architecture and a passion for creating spaces <br>
           that are both functional an inspriring, I specialize in residential architecture <br>
           that embodies sustainability and is also economically viable.
        </p>
        <p>
            My approach to architecture blends inovation with practicality. Every project <br>
            begins with listening, understanding the clients vision, lifestyle and needs - <br>
            so that the final design is not only beautiful but also deeply personal and purposeful. <br>
        </p>
